# -Reducing-Packaging-Costs-and-Enhancing-Sustainability-in-Warehouse-Operations-
This project aims to reduce packaging costs in warehouse operations while aligning with sustainability goals. The initiative involves evaluating high-cost, environmentally unfriendly packaging materials currently in use, then transitioning to eco-friendly, cost-effective alternatives.

Hereâ€™s a complete step-by-step guide for a project, from MySQL data extraction to Power BI visualization. This example assumes you have a dataset related to monthly consumption data for various articles and want to visualize month-over-month reduction.

Step 1: Define the Project Scope
Objective: Analyze six months of article-wise consumption data to showcase month-over-month reduction in consumption amount.

Tools Used:

MySQL for data extraction and manipulation
Power BI for visualization and reporting
Step 2: Data Extraction Using MySQL
Assume your database has a table consumption_data with the following structure:

Column Name	Data Type	Description
article_id	INT	Unique identifier for each article
article_name	VARCHAR	Name of the article
month	DATE	Month and year of consumption
consumption_units	INT	Number of units consumed
consumption_cost	DECIMAL	Total cost of consumption for the month
warehouse_id	INT	Warehouse location identifier (optional)

Sample Data

article_id	article_name	month	consumption_units	consumption_cost
1	Article A	2024-05-01	300	6000
2	Article B	2024-05-01	150	3000

Step 2.1: SQL Query to Pull Data
This query fetches the last six months of data, organized by article and month.

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    article_id,
    article_name,
    DATE_FORMAT(month, '%Y-%m') AS month,
    SUM(consumption_units) AS total_units,
    SUM(consumption_cost) AS total_cost
FROM 
    consumption_data
WHERE 
    month BETWEEN DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH) AND CURDATE()
GROUP BY 
    article_id, month
ORDER BY 
    article_id, month;
Explanation: This query groups consumption data by article and month, summing up consumption_units and consumption_cost.
Result: The output will have each article's monthly data for the past six months.
Export Data to CSV
After running the query, export the results to a CSV file (or directly connect MySQL to Power BI if possible).
**
Step 3: Load Data into Power BI**
Open Power BI Desktop.
Import Data:
Select Get Data > Text/CSV (if you exported CSV) or MySQL Database to connect directly to MySQL.
Choose your dataset and load it into Power BI.
